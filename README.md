Biased vs UnBiased dice in a board game.

The idea was to see if there was a difference in the distribution of the number of times a player lands on a particular position of a board while using a biased and an unbiased die. The code generates plots with the axis as positions on a board and the y axis as the number of times the player lands on it.

simulateGame(no, dist): Simulates a board game with 40 possible places for a player to land at in 1 round. The simulation runs for *n* rounds.
runSimulation(no): Runs *no* games and generates a plot of the number of times a player lands in a position.
roll(dist): simulates a dice roll. Can be a biased or unbiased die based on *dist* array provided.
